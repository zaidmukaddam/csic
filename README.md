## :thinking: Motivation

Since the iTunes era I like to customize my music collection with pretty covers and in Spotify, I like to follow the pattern they adopt in their official playlists.

## üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Build with Gatsby w/ TypeScript and styled-components.
- Using some awesome dependencies like dom-to-image-more, file-saver, react-color and react-draggable.
- Multiple languages with i18next
- Also, with ESLint, Prettier, stylelint, Husky, lint-staged and [much more](package.json).
